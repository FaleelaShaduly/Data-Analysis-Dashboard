## US Furniture Sales Dashboard | Power BI Capstone Project

## Project Overview
An Executive Power BI dashboard built for the US Furniture Sales organization to deliver a single-pane, data-driven view of revenue, profitability, and operational performance across regions, segments, branches, and product sub-categories. Designed for Executive Insights, Granular Reporting, and Mobile Accessibility, the solution helps leaders act quickly on margin pressure, regional gaps, and product-level opportunities.

## Dashboard Features
- Revenue, Products, and Profit Summary for quick executive review.
- Sales by City, State, Region, and Segment to compare geographic and customer performance.
- Sub-Category Analysis to identify top revenue drivers and loss-making products.
- Employee and Branch Performance to support incentives and training.
- Mobile-Ready Layout for on-the-go decision making.

## Tools & Technologies
- Power BI Desktop – Dashboard creation
- Power Query – Data cleaning & transformation
- DAX – Calculated metrics, dynamic rankings, and KPIs

## Key Insights
- Top-line and margin: Total Revenue $9.89M with Profit $286.4K yields a 2.89% margin, heavily impacted by $1.6M in discounts.
- Regional strength: West and East lead in revenue; South underperforms in sales.
- The map shows that sales are distributed across many cities, indicating a broad customer base rather than a few concentrated markets, which supports stability but requires robust logistics.
- Segment concentration: Consumer segment accounts for ~51% of revenue, creating concentration risk.
- Product dynamics: Chairs, Phones, and Tables drive revenue but some high-volume items (Paper, Binders) deliver low profit.
- Some high-revenue categories operate on lower margins, indicating potential opportunities for pricing review, supplier cost optimization, or product mix adjustments.
- Employee patterns: Some sellers generate high revenue from fewer units; others rely on volume—useful for targeted coaching.

## Actionable Recommendations
1.	Reconcile and validate totals before strategic decisions.
2.	Reduce discount leakage with caps, approvals, and targeted promotions.
3.	Replicate West and East tactics in underperforming regions via pilots.
4.	Promote high-margin products and de-prioritize discounts on low-margin, high-volume SKUs.
5.	Align incentives to margin, not just units or revenue.
6.	Reallocate staff and inventory from underperforming branches to high-opportunity locations.
7.	Identify top revenue-efficient sellers and replicate their selling techniques.
8.	Provide pricing and product-mix training to volume-based sellers.
