# Data-Analysis-Dashboard
I built a Power BI executive dashboard that delivers a clear snapshot of US furniture sales, profit, and overall performance across regions, segments, products, and branches. It enables fast, data driven decisions by surfacing insights on revenue, margins, product mix, and employee performance, helping optimize pricing, discounts, and operations.
